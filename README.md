    This page supports the Lecture on practical exercises on Hadoop
    MapReduce. In the following, you will find links to the lecture
    itself, a link to a broader tutorial covering also the theory
    behind MapReduce, and some basic software requirements to work
    with the exercises.

    The tutorial and this lecture have been profoundly influenced by
    two "must-have" books on Hadoop and MapReduce:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom White, <strong>Hadoop, The Definitive Guide</strong>,
      Y!Press, O'Reilly</li>
      <li>Jimmy Lin, Chris Dyer, <strong>Data-Intensive Text
    Processing with MapReduce</strong>, Morgan Claypool ed.</li>
    </ul>

    Please note that the structure of the following slides follows the
    vairious chapters of the above books. Moreover, several other
    presentations and tutorial have been used to complement the book
    material.
