# Instructions for the Laboratory sessions on MapReduce, Hive and Pig

This page supports the Lecture on practical exercises on Hadoop MapReduce. 
In the following some basic software requirements to work with the exercises.

The tutorial and this lecture have been profoundly influenced by two "must-have" books on Hadoop and MapReduce:

+ Tom White, **Hadoop, The Definitive Guide**, Y!Press, O'Reilly
+ Jimmy Lin, Chris Dyer, **Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce**, Morgan Claypool ed.

## Software setup
To work with the exercises, you need to download and install java sdk and eclipse. 
You also need to download and install Hadoop 0.20.203.0.
